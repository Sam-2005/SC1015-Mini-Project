# Car Prediction and Testing Project
## Overview
This repository contains the project files for analyzing and predicting car data. The project involves using machine learning techniques to predict various aspects related to cars, such as prices, performance, and specifications.

The files included in this project are as follows:
1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning.py) - This Python script includes the initial data processing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for further analysis.
2. [Feature Engineering and Initial Testing](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/blob/master/Untitled1.py) - This script is used for feature extraction and engineering, as well as initial testing of machine learning models.
3. [Car Prediction and Testing](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/blob/master/car%20prediction%20and%20testing.ipynb) - This Jupyter notebook contains the detailed analysis, model training, and predictions using various machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here]([https://linktodataset.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aishwaryamuthukumar/cars-dataset-audi-bmw-ford-hyundai-skoda-vw)). It contains various features of cars, including make, model, year, specifications, and price, which are used to train our predictive models.

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning
The dataset contains numerous features, which include both numerical and categorical data. This step involves:
- Cleaning NaN or invalid data entries
- Normalizing data scales
- Encoding categorical data for model compatibility

### Feature Engineering and Initial Testing
After cleaning, the data undergoes a process of feature selection:
- New features are engineered to enhance model accuracy
- Correlation and causation analysis is done to select significant features
- Initial model tests are performed to evaluate feature effectiveness

### Car Prediction and Testing
Machine learning models tested in this phase:
- autoencoder which is a type of neural networks is applied to predict car prices and specifications
- Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance
- Model performance is evaluated based on metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared

## Results
This table denotes performance statistics for the models:

| Accuracy       |      MSE      |
| :---           |          ---: |
|   99.970045%   |    0.000299   |

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that it is possible to recommend car listings with relatively high accuracy (>99%), despite the highly imbalanced parameter. More importantly, our model is able to hit almost 100% accuracy with recommending cars, which is important as creating a model that inaccurately recommends cars which are not according to the users preference.
